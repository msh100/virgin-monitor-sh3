# virgin-monitor-sh3
Monitor a Virgin SuperHub 3.0

This app is developed for personal use but I will offer limited assistance to others who wish to run it.

## Usage

Like any other python program, create a virtualenv, install the requirements and run `python app.py`.
Requires I think Python 3.6.

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

App will run on http://127.0.0.1:8080
